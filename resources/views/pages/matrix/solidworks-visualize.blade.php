        <p>SOLIDWORKS Visualize is hardware-agnostic and can leverage one or many GPUs in a single machine or across a
          network, which dramatically increases rendering performance over CPU hardware.</p>
        <p>Utilizing NVIDIA® graphics card(s) for rendering is much faster than competitor CPU technology and helps to
          speed
          up your daily workflow, generating more content. This feature alone provides dramatic acceleration of the
          design and
          engineering process.</p>
        <p>SOLIDWORKS Visualize performs faster on all hardware, including entry-level laptops (using new Fast Render
          mode).
        </p>
        <p>SOLIDWORKS Visualize can also leverage emerging GPU technology from NVIDIA, such as the NVIDIA Quadro® VCA,
          for
          linear boosts in render speeds, resulting in a more efficient and productive 3D visualization experience.</p>

        <p>In addition to leveraging one or many GPUs or CPUs, SOLIDWORKS Visualize can leverage both GPU and CPU
          simultaneously
          (Hybrid mode) in a single machine or across a network, which dramatically increases rendering performance.
          This render
          mode allows entry-level machines to have increased performance to generate content faster.</p>

        <p>Using NVIDIA’s Iray® render engine inside of SOLIDWORKS Visualize, you view a precise and physically correct
          representation of your CAD model, as if you had physically produced it.</p>
        <p>Lighting, materials, and form all come together realistically without sacrificing visual quality and not
          taking
          shortcuts to increase render speeds.</p>
        <p>Physically-based raytracing is more than just pretty pictures—it’s critical digital accuracy that shows what
          your
          design will look like in the real world.</p>

        <p>The SOLIDWORKS Visualize user interface (UI), with integrated Viewport and lack of complex node-based
          materials, is
          designed for users who don’t have time to learn a complex new tool. The SOLIDWORKS Visualize UI can be further
          simplified to just five buttons at the bottom of the screen in Easy Mode. This mode is designed for users who
          have
          no 3D background and just need a simple visualization tool. Enjoy the new sub-tabs in the Palette, simplified
          Import
          and Render windows, and much more. You also can now select between a dark theme and light theme.</p>
