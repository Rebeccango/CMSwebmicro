        <p>Handle all aspects of your part and assembly modeling with the SOLIDWORKS 3D design system for transforming
          ideas and concepts into virtual 3D models. For conceptual design, create 3D designs quickly using imported
          images, simple sketches, or scanned 3D data, and then add more details as the design evolves. Assembly
          structure planning lets you quickly lay out your design assembly structure and then export to SOLIDWORKS for
          automatically creating CAD files. Direct model editing lets you manipulate and modify 3D geometry working
          directly on 3D CAD models.</p>
