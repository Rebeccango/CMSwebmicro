          a Subscription Service?</h1>
        <p>
          Subscription service is a critical component of your software investment. Very few companies or individuals
          who buy software do so without the subscription package that suits them best.<br />
          <br />CAD MicroSolutions customizes subscription services programs to meet the customers unique requirements.
          While your subscription package is in place you are guaranteed an upgrade path to each new version of the
          software.<br />
          <br />Subscription service also includes full access to a host of resources made available from CAD Micro
          including certified engineers, on-site services, telephone support, online training videos, upgrade training,
          local events, access to webinar’s sessions plus many others.

          <br />Speak with our Subscription Services Manager or your Account Manager for more information.
